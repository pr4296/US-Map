# US-Map
A C++ school project that uses publicly available elevation, city, and connecting distances data to draw and determine the shortest path between any two user-provided cities.

The executable can be found at under US-Map/MapProject/Release/MapProject.exe
(Screenshots are included in the main folder)

Disclaimer: Big cities in this file are broken into North/South/East/West CityName, so places like Chicago or Houston don't work, but North Chicago and South Houston do.
